# Critical Temperature Prediction
Superconducting materials are used in various applications: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), particle
accelerator and magnetic fusion devices, electric power transmission. . . They are characterized by a zero
resistance under a particular temperature called: critical temperature. The purpose of this project is to
predict this temperature having different properties (features) of the studied material as inputs.
